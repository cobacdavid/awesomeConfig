All this config is perfect for ME.

## Looking for widgets
Go into the `widgets` directory, there's another `README.md` file.

## my `rc.lua`

My awesomewm rc file is divided into files (files you could easily
imagine in the original rc file).

If you have a look to them, you have to understand that this config
is intented to fit two PCs: a desktop PC ("maison") and a laptop
("asus"), the desktop one is connected to 2 screens (left has a
portrait orientation) and the laptop may be connected from time to
time to a quite low-res interface as a second screen (landscape
only).
